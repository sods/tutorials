Take a look at [*Navier Stokes equations*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations)
and find out what they are used for. What are the pure mathematics aspects of the equations and what are the applied mathematics aspects? Where does computation come in?

Think about the relationship between Computer Science and
Maths. In absolute terms we many of the challenges of
Computer Science are how to *implement* maths on a Computer (e.g. the
Turing test, the way a processor works). For Mathematics,
particularly pure mathematics, there is a lot of interest in
*separating* the maths from the implementation. Mathematics can stand
alone, outside implementation, emerging purely through abstract thought.


Have a look at the Wikipedia page for [*Principia
Mathematica*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica) and
 [*Godel's incompleteness theorem*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) as well as the [*Barber Paradox*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_paradox). How does this sort of pure mathematical thinking effect Computer Science?
