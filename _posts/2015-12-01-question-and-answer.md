This session will be a question and answer session about every thing you've been through in this first semester, including data hide meetings, Daniel Bernhardt's talk and the general scope and direction of the course.

As material for further discussion please read through the [*Computer Science First Yearâ€™s Tutorial
Booklet*](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/tutorials/level1/firstyeartutorials.pdf)
on *assignments and feedback (Semester 1, week 7)* and *review of progress (Semester 1, week 9)*. Think about the different forms of
assessment you receive. How do DCS and SoMaS differ in their ways of
providing you feedback? How does the teaching philosophy in DCS and SoMaS differ?
