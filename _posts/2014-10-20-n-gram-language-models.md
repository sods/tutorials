Discussion of [*n-grams*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) and how
to model language, and starting thinking more about the spell checking
problem that Daniel will talk about. We’ll have a simple review of
probability and how to relate marginals and conditional probabilities
and think about how probability can be used to represent sequences. In
particular you should refresh yourself on the sum rule of probability
and the product rule of probability.

We spoke about how to create a joint distribution of probability given a
conditional and a good question was asked. Given the model of a sequence
for a triplet, how do we predict the probability of the *middle* word.
We answered using the sum rule and the product rule.

**Plagiarism: Non-Academic Task 2**

We covered plagiarism by starting a conversation on licensing of code in
computer science. How the open source licenses work and the importance
of open source software (BSD Unix and Linux) in modern operating
systems. This led on to general ideas of giving credit for work, arising
from the introduction of copyright law, and how we need to give credit
in academic work.

In two weeks time our meeting will focus on the John Baez special
topics. Everyone should select a topic to present. You can also work in
pairs to discuss and present your topic. We will present special topics
starting in Week 6.
