title: Background Reading: John Baez
---

No meeting this week due to lack of room availability (sorry, I need to
get more organised on the rooms).

In your own time, I’d like you to have a look at a mathematician called
[*John Baez*](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/). He is a Mathematical
Physicist at University of California, Riverside. He’s got interests in
network theory, information geometry and more recently the climate. He
posts regular interesting articles. Here’s a few posts that I find
particularly interesting.

We will look at Google+ and check how to follow his Please can I suggest

The [*Sheffield graduate development program*](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/sgdp/index)) is about how you
should be developing your CV alongside your academic work. You should
create a new version of your CV and think about how it will read to
prospective employers or companies where you might want to do an
internship. (Semester 1, week 3)
